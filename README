# eViasWeb platform
#
# This platform is completely open source and mostly
# developed to introduce myself and my projects.
# Some of my web modules will be tested using this platform.
# This means that some of the features may be buggy or
# not finished.

# BEFORE WORK:
# /eviasweb/library/Zend
# should point to your zf-1.11.0 directory .
#
# git clone git@github.com:evias/eviasphp.git library/
# mv library/eviasphp library/eVias
