"5 years ago I discovered the PHP language and its easy-to-use features. I am now able "
"to confirm a very advanced skill using PHP. Although PHP will cover loads of features, "
"it is not possible, using PHP, to develop a user friendly, dynamic interface. "
"Which is why I have been using Javascript for about 3 years. The new HTML5 and CSS3 standards "
"could change a lot in the manner of developing a web application, and so I have also been studying "
"these new standards."

msgid "__INFO_DATA_WEBDEV_2__"
msgstr ""
"The new web application development standards may revolution these given applications. "
"Any web developer is now able to develop friendly interfaces and improve the user "
"experience on their site, by following the correct HTML5 and CSS3 standards. "
"Not only will it give us developers a better and easier way to publish our works, but it will "
"also allow us to develop web applications, near to be as user friendly as Desktop applications ."

msgid "__INFO_DATA_WEBDEV_3__"
msgstr ""
"Web developments are popular because of their small development delay and because of their "
"everywhere-usability. You, indeed, only need a browser, as in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome "
" or Internet Explorer to execute these applications."

"I started developping desktop applications as I was 12 years old. I used to develop "
"applications using C / Win32 and C++ / Qt. By now, I can interact on many more sectors "
"of the desktop application development. As I have been working with multi-threading, database "
"optimizations and project architecture, I am now able to develop any of your software needs."

msgid "__INFO_DATA_APPDEV_2__"
msgstr ""
"Desktop applications require a longer development delay and they need a good kernel to be "
"developped upon. In order to secure the application, there is a need of a library that will "
"cover most of the daily desktop application development tasks."

msgid "__INFO_DATA_APPDEV_3__"
msgstr ""
"Which is the reason why I have been developing my C++ library for about 2 years now. "
"This library stands for an easier, faster, simpler and more effective way of deploying "
"and developing applications. As far as it will summarize a desktop application's development "
"to the development of business layers and user interfaces. This reduces the delay of "
"development of some important days."
